## Overview

AlphaWolf is a comprehensive AI-powered platform supporting neurodivergent individuals, with a focus on assistive technologies for cognitive care, safety, and personal empowerment for those with Alzheimer's and dementia. 

AlphaWolf is a spiritual sibling to  (a multi-modal neurodiverse inclusive speech-generating artificial intelligence designed for nonverbal autistic individuals), adapted specifically for dementia and Alzheimer's care applications.

## Core Modules

### Family Protection System
The Family Protection System monitors safety through geofencing, location monitoring, and risk assessment. Key features include:

- **Geofencing**: Define safe zones and receive alerts when a person leaves these areas
- **Unusual Movement Detection**: Identify potentially dangerous movement patterns
- **Risk Communication Analysis**: Detect concerning language in communications

### Web Crawler
The Web Crawler retrieves authoritative information about Alzheimer's and dementia from trusted sources:

- **Topic Search**: Find relevant information on specific topics
- **Research Retrieval**: Access the latest research on dementia conditions
- **Fact Extraction**: Extract factual statements from content

### Content Filtering & Risk Analysis
Content processing with risk assessment:

- **Message Risk Analysis**: Evaluate input for concerning content
- **Safety Reporting**: Generate comprehensive safety reports
- **Alert Generation**: Produce structured alerts for potential safety issues

## Serverless Architecture

AlphaWolf is built as a serverless application on AWS with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Edge-optimized, handling all API requests
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for all processing
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL storage for interaction history, locations, and content
- **SQS**: Message queuing for alerts and asynchronous processing
- **S3**: Storage for static content and data
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
