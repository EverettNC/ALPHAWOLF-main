Studies show that individuals with strong social networks experience slower cognitive decline compared to those who are socially isolated. This appears to be mediated through multiple pathways, including reduced stress, increased cognitive stimulation through conversation, and improved health behaviors. I recommend that families of those with dementia focus on maintaining meaningful social interactions, even as communication abilities change.',

For example, wandering may indicate boredom or a need for exercise, while agitation might signal pain, hunger, or overstimulation. By addressing the underlying need rather than just the behavior, we can improve quality of life and reduce caregiver stress. This approach requires careful observation and detective work but leads to more humane and effective care.',
