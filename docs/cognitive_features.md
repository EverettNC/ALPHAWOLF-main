#  Cognitive Enhancement Features

## Overview

The  cognitive enhancement features extend the AlphaWolf platform with advanced AI capabilities specifically designed for individuals with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. These features are adapted from the  system, originally developed for nonverbal neurodivergent individuals, and provide a comprehensive set of tools to improve quality of life and care.

## Key Components

### Adaptive Learning System

The adaptive learning system can improve itself over time by learning from interactions with patients. It gathers information about dementia and Alzheimer's to provide better care and adapts to individual patient preferences and needs.

**Key Features:**
- Self-improving neural models that learn from patient interactions
- Research gathering capabilities to stay updated on dementia and Alzheimer's care
- Personalized response generation based on patient's communication style and preferences
- Time-of-day adaptations to account for sundowning and other temporal factors

### Voice Mimicry System

The voice mimicry system learns from voice samples provided by patients and can generate speech that sounds similar to the patient's own voice, making interactions more natural and comforting.

**Key Features:**
- Voice sample collection and analysis
- Speech pattern recognition
- Speech synthesis with patient voice characteristics
- Emphasis patterns and cadence matching

### Symbol-Based Communication

The symbol-based communication system provides an alternative way for patients who have difficulty with verbal communication to express their needs, emotions, and requests using customizable symbol boards.

**Key Features:**
- Customizable symbol boards with categories for different needs
- Context-aware symbol suggestions based on time of day and routines
- Ability to add custom symbols with personal meaning
- Usage tracking to improve symbol suggestions over time

### AR Navigation System

The augmented reality (AR) navigation system helps patients with indoor navigation, provides object recognition, and delivers contextual reminders to assist with orientation and daily tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Floor plan management for different locations
- Navigation instruction generation with adjustable complexity
- Object recognition to help identify important items
- Location-based reminders and guidance

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The cognitive enhancement features are built on a modular architecture that allows each component to function independently while also integrating seamlessly with the core AlphaWolf platform.

- **Backend**: Python Flask-based API services with data storage in PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: JavaScript client library for integration with the web interface
- **Data**: Patient cognitive models, speech patterns, symbol boards, and location layouts

### Dependencies

- OpenAI API for advanced cognitive capabilities
- gtts (Google Text-to-Speech) for voice synthesis
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing
- Trafilatura for web scraping research data

### Data Storage

- Patient cognitive models stored in JSON format
- Voice samples saved as audio files
- Symbol boards organized by patient and category
- Location layouts with custom floor plans

## Usage Examples

### Adaptive Learning

```python
# Initialize a patient's cognitive model
result = cognitive_enhancement.initialize_patient_model(patient_id, patient_data)

# Process a patient interaction
result = cognitive_enhancement.process_interaction(patient_id, {
    'type': 'conversation',
    'content': 'Good morning, how are you today?',
    'metrics': {'success_rate': 0.8, 'engagement': 0.9}
})

# Generate an adaptive response
response = cognitive_enhancement.generate_personalized_content(
    patient_id, 'response', {'input': 'What day is it today?'}
)
```

### Voice Mimicry

```python
# Add a voice sample
result = voice_mimicry.add_voice_sample(
    patient_id, audio_data, transcript
)

# Generate speech
speech = voice_mimicry.generate_mimicked_speech(
    patient_id, "It's time to take your medication."
)
```

### Symbol Communication

```python
# Create a symbol board
board = symbol_communication.create_symbol_board(
    patient_id, "My Communication Board"
)

# Add a custom symbol
symbol = symbol_communication.add_custom_symbol(
    patient_id, "emotions", "Anxious", 
    "I'm feeling anxious", image_data
)

# Get contextual suggestions
suggestions = symbol_communication.get_contextual_suggestions(
    patient_id, "morning", "kitchen"
)
```

### AR Navigation

```python
# Add a floor plan
layout = ar_navigation.add_location_layout(
    patient_id, "Home", layout_data, floor_plan_image
)

# Generate navigation instructions
instructions = ar_navigation.generate_navigation_instructions(
    patient_id, layout_id, "Kitchen", "Bathroom", "simple"
)
```

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with wearable devices for real-time health monitoring
- Enhanced voice synthesis using more advanced speech models
- AR glasses integration for real-time visual guidance
- Predictive care suggestions based on behavioral patterns
- Remote caregiver monitoring and alert enhancements
